BUILDING
========

The source can now be built using Gradle:

From the root dir:

gradle assemble

Some info on gradle can be found:

http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html

This builds a jar file in vsl/build/lib/vsl-VERSION.jar.  By default this jar will run TestCore1.

It seems that 'java' (as opposed to javac) does not use the classpath so it has to be called with:

java -cp $CLASSPATH


JAVADOCS
========

We can build either standard javadocs (public interfaces only):

gradle javadocs

Alternately to view full documentation for private and protected classes use:

gradle intJavaDoc

Either option will put the generated docs in build/docs/javadoc/.
