Getting Started
===============

We start by cloning the repository:

git clone git@github.com:funnydevnull/vsl.git

This creates a local copy which is referred to as "origin".

We can/should also add it to our list of remotes so that we can work with it.  

git remote add vsl git://github.com/funnydevnull/vsl.git


Updating
========

To update local copy from remove _without_ automatically merging we use fetch:

git fetch vsl

Afterwards try 

git hist --all

to see the status of things.

Dealing with a merge
--------------------


Pushing Updates
===============


Viewing/Diffing
===============

A useful history command:

git hist --all

Removing Staged
===============

Removing files accidentally added to index:

git rm --cached FILE
git reset HEAD <file>


Ignoring Files
==============

To ignore files (e.g. when adding whole directories) add the following lines to ~/.gitconfig:

excludesfile = /home/<user>/.gitignore

and then create a .gitingore file with content e.g.:

*.sw?
*~

The above ignores e.g. vim swap files and files ending in "~" (temp files used by e.g. gedit).
