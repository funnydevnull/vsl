BUILDING
========

See BUILD.txt.

CONFIGURATION
=============

VSL uses a config file vsl.conf which is located in config/vsl.conf.  


ENVIRONMENT & SETUP
===================

To try running testing VSL the test scripts in vsl/scripts should be used.

The following sequence of commands setups the test environments.  First setup a
vsl.conf file in vsl/conf.

# cd vsl/scripts
# source setdevenv.sh
# testcore1.sh create ...  (see below)
# testcoreindex.sh create ... (see below)

Once setdevenv.sh has been run the test scripts are in the path and can be run from anywhere.

NOTE: setdevenv.sh uses its current location to correctly setup the path so run
it from inside vsl/scripts!
NOTE: all scripts assume vsl.conf is in vsl/config.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=========
TestCore1
=========

Basic test of core functionality.  Here's the output of its instructions:

-----------------------------
TestCore1 must be called with args:

 TestCore1 <cmd> <config_file> [cmd args]

Commands: store, show, update, printMap

Cmd args:

	store:	  	[string]	A string that seeds the test data.
		      	  [numChunks]	Number of chunks to create

	show:	  	  [entryID]		The vslID of an entry to show.

	update:	  	[entryID]		The vslID of an entry to update.
		        	[versionID]	The vslID of the version to update.

		      	  [string]	A string that seeds the update data.

		        	[numChunks]	Not used yet but must be passed an int here.

	printMap**:	[bytesToShow]	(Number of bytes of each chunk to show.


**printMap takes the db_file rather than the config file as a second argument.
-----------------------------

CREATE AN ENTRY:
---------------

To run try (last two args optional):

java vsl.test.TestCore1 store <config_file> [data_string] [numChunks]

Example: 

java vsl.test.TestCore1 store config/vsl.cfg howdy 12

will generate an Entry with one Version and numChunks data chunks (there's a
default value) and store them in a vslMMBackend which stores itself to
filename.  NOTE: the db file is specifyied in the config file.


UPDATE AN ENTRY
---------------

To run try (last two args optional):

java vsl.test.TestCore1 store <config_file> <entryid> <versionid> [data_string] [numChunks]

Example: 

java vsl.test.TestCore1 update config/vsl.cfg  772450591 887385360  SXXXYSDF 4 

Updates version number 887385360 in the entry with id 772450591.

EXAMINE AN ENTRY
---------------

To run try (last two args optional):

java vsl.test.TestCore1 show <config_file> <entryid> 

Example: 

java vsl.test.TestCore1 show config/vsl.cfg  772450591 

Note that this will display the version tree and allow you to interactively
examine versions and chunks.

NOTE: this method uses the vsl read functionality not the underlying
vslMMBackend (unlike printMap below).

DUMP DB:
--------

To read/dump the contents of the multipmap use:

java vsl.test.TestCore1 printMap <dbfile> 

NOTE: this dumps the multimap directly rather than using the VSL core so it
needs the db file NOT the vsl-config file.  Its mostly for finding vslIDs and
examing the backend.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=========
TestCoreIndex
=========

Basic test of indices in core system.

The best way to run this is using the wrapper script testindex.sh in the scripts dir.

Here's the output of its instructions:

-----------------------------
TestCoreIndex must be called with args:

 TestCoreIndex <cmd> <config_file> [cmd args]

Commands: create, add, mod, show, printMap

Cmd args:

	create:		create a new index with a single element.

			[data]	The string data for the first element in the index.

	add:		add a new element to the index.

			[indexID]	The vslID of an index where we add the element.
			[data]		The string data for the first element in the index.

	mod:		update/delete elements in an index interactively.

			[indexID]	The vslID of the index which the element is part of.

	show:		display the structure of an index interactively.

			[indexID]	The vslID of the index which the element is part of.

	printMap**:	[bytesToShow]	(Number of bytes of each chunk to show.


**printMap takes the db_file rather than the config file as a second argument.
-----------------------------

CREATE AN INDEX AND POPULATE IT WITH ONE ELEMENT:
----------------------------------------------

To run try:

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex create <config_file> <data_string>

Example: 

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex create config/vsl.cfg RandomInitialData

will generate an index with one element whose data is "RandomInitialData" and
store them in a vslMMBackend db.  NOTE: the db file is specifyied in the config
file.

ADD AN ELEMENT TO AN INDEX:
--------------------------

To run try:

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex add <config_file> <indexid> <data_string>

Example: 

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex create config/vsl.cfg 772450591  NewElementData



UPDATE AN INDEX ELEMENTS (INTERACTIVELY)
-------------------------------

To run try (last two args optional):

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex mod <config_file> <indexID> 

Example: 

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex mod config/vsl.cfg  772450591 

Prompts the user for input on updating an index with vslID 772450591.

EXAMINE AN INDEX
---------------

To run:

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex show <config_file>  <indexid> 

Example: 

java vsl.test.TestCoreIndex show config/vsl.cfg  772450591 

Note that this will display the elements in index and let you interactively update/delete elements.
Adding elements should be done with the add command.

DUMP DB:
--------

To read/dump the contents of the multipmap use:

java vsl.test.TestCore1 printMap <dbfile> 

NOTE: this dumps the multimap directly rather than using the VSL core so it
needs the db file NOT the vsl-config file.  Its mostly for finding vslIDs and
examing the backend.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


================
FileChunkingTest
================

This test file chunking now USING vsl core.

To run cd to vsl/src and execute as below.

Chunking
--------

Chunk a file (in this case vsl_deisng_notes-1.tex) and store in the vsl DB-file mydb:

java vsl.test.FileChunkingTest create config/vsl.cfg  ../test/input/version/vsl_design_notes-1.tex

NOTE: chunking params currently hard-coded (i.e. size of chunk and begin
token).  Should make them args.

Reading
-------

Since VSL doesn't yet support reading out entries we can't directly read or
reconstruct a file but instead we can access it using the printMap method in
the vslMMBackend but this requires using the TestCore1 class.

java vsl.test.TestCore1 read config/vsl.cfg [numBytes]

By default this method only shows the first 100 bytes of each data entry but by
providing an arg this can be increased.


Rechunking
----------

This test chunks a file and then tries to chunk the second file while reusing
as many chunks as it can from the first (i.e. this is a chunk-based diff).  It can be called as follows:

java vsl.test.FileChunkingTest compare <original_file> <modified_file>

To check that its properly rechunking this program can unchunk its internal
copy of each file and store them into a new file so you can diff them against
the input files (to make sure the rechunking is working correctly).  

When the test is run it prompts you if you would like it to rebuild the input
file (both the original and the modified one) from its internally stored chunks
(note these chunks are not stored to VSL since we don't yet support read/update
of the core).  By default the new files are stored to <filename>-rebuilt.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=================
ByteHashSpeedTest
=================

Some test code to determine how to quickly rechunk a file.  

There are three basic commands: <testByte>, <chunkSame>, <chunkDiff>

testByte
--------

java vsl.test.ByteHashSpeedTest testByte <str1> <str2> ...

Tests our doubly-linked list of bytes (ByteDLL) implementation that allows us
to quickly match a byte sequence to a list of stored byte arrays.  Note that
performance is actually mostly due to a prestruct we have in this class that
vastly speeds up our search.

Try for instance:

java vsl.test.ByteHashSpeedTest testByte heya heyb heee hapo yaho

Note: for consistent results the strings should all be the SAME LENGTH (this is
not a bug as this is the relevant use case when considering file token
identifiers -- beginTokens). 

Also for efficiency reasons we do very litle error checking but it is assumed
that both the input strings and the search strings are greater than 3 in
length.

chunkSame
---------

Another tester tries chunking a file then rechunking it using various
techniques (hashing chunk identifiers, etc...).  This test has a lot of old
code in it that we probably don't need anymore.  The final rechunking is done
with our efficient struct.

Call it as:

java vsl.test.ByteHashSpeedTest rechunkSame <filename> <chunkSize> <beginTokenSize>

Note: should have beginTokenSize < chunkSize

For instance:

java vsl.test.ByteHashSpeedTest rechunkSame test_files/large.pdf 10000 100

chunkDiff
---------

Chunk two different versions of the file and compare the chunking.  We first
chunk <file1> and use it to generate a table of tokens and associated chunks.
We then check <file2> and see how many chunks from our chunking of <file1> we can find.  Note we do not actually chunk <file2>.  
This code can be used to test speed/efficiency of different chunk lengths,
etc...

Call it using:

java vsl.test.ByteHashSpeedTest rechunkDiff <orignal file> <new file version> <chunkSize> <beginTokenSize>

Note: should have beginTokenSize < chunkSize.  These refer of coure to the original chunking.

For instance:

java vsl.test.ByteHashSpeedTest rechunkSame test_files/version1.pdf test_files/version2.pdf 10000 100



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================
SerializingTest:
================

To run test:

java vsl.test.SerializingTest put mykey myval
java vsl.test.SerializingTest put mykey2 myval2

then 

java vsl.test.SerializingTest read 

If we use MultiValueMap from apache need to include classpath:

javac -cp .:../lib/commons-collections-3.2.1.jar  vsl/test/SerializingTest.java
