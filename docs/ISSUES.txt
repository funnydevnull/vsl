ISSUES
======

We use this file to track open issues with the system.  This can be
features we need to implement but want to hold off on or simple problems we
notice along the way, etc...

Please remove issues once they've been fixed.


FileChunking:
------------

- We required fixed size tokens but this can be a problem because if we fix a
  tokenSize there might be chunks smaller than that token size (e.g. near the
  end of the file).  How do we want to handle such cases?  We need to
  cleanup ByteDLL to suppor variable length tokens :-(

NOTE: we handle this fine in generating the begin/end Tokens but the problem is
that ByteDLL assumes it gets equal length tokens which may now no longer be the
case.  If we pad them with zeros we'll probably never match them to the file
data.  Unless we do this only for ByteDLL but for the actual comparison we use
only the real token?

- In rechunking a file we don't yet handle the possibility of two identical
  beginTokens that correspond to different chunks.  To do this we should put
  chunks in a multimap when checking them against tokens.  

Core To Do
==========

A list of stuff we need to think about still:

vslBackendData:
--------------
- Store length of data chunks in vslChunkData
- Add some serialID's to vslBackendData subclasses
- Some sort of digest to all vslBackendData
- Add a hash of the vslChunkData's data to the chunkHeader.


General
-------

- vslID needs to be flexible enough to support different types of backend
  hash's/ids.  Maybe the id should just be a general object?  
- Or do we want to allow backends to override vslID?
- Likewise vslHash needs to be thought of more carefully.

- We should catch _ClassCastExceptions_ when reading out data from the
  backend in case someone gives the vsl id.  Might be better to wrap
  backend methods in more specific calls such as getVersionHeaders(),
  getChunkHeaders(), etc...



vslVesion
---------
- We don't currently implement an equals method which might be useful e.g. in
  vslVersion.addNext() to make sure we don't add the same next version twice.




Source Version Control
---------------

- We should start including per-source-file versioning info (like CVS lets you
  do). Do we automate this or do it by hand?
